\section{BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK}
\label{sec:background}
\glsresetall

This chapter reviews the background and related work from academic and credible non-academic sources, such as, recognized international organizations, military institutions, and renowned think-tanks, in the areas of active and responsive cyber defence, cyber operations, cyber red teaming, and cyber red team oriented technical exercises.
Additionally, the gaps are identified and contribution to address these issues is emphasized.

\subsection{Identified Gaps}
\glsresetall
Related work analysis shows that no substantial work has been done in the area of exploring the aspects the cyber red team technical capability development, execution of responsive cyber defence operations, and conducting technical exercises aimed at cyber red team training and skill development.
The main drawbacks are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item red teaming is acknowledged by nations primary as a supportive element to decision making process, providing an alternative analysis on various topics, but not anticipated as an operational capability to actively pursue the commander assigned external targets. The red team, consisting of highly skilled experts, might be engaged in cyber espionage, or targeting organization's own defences to provide adversarial perspective. However, it is not yet accepted to be used actively against any other target or threat actor. A broader perspective and the scope of cyber red team capability applicability has to be expanded;
    \item cyber kill-chain has been thoroughly reviewed from the defence perspective, as its primary area of application, however, the view from the adversarial aspect on countering the cyber kill-chain should be explored. By countering the cyber kill-chain, in this work, is understood the red team \gls{tttp} allowing to bypass the detection and prevention mechanisms at every phase of the kill-chain. This is especially important when planning the cyber operations against an advanced adversary to ensure the maximum possible success rate;
    \item cyber red team technical capabilities and techniques for tool development to be used against a real adversary are not explored fully. The proper techniques and tools are even more important when a small cyber red team (up to 9 members) is considered to be engaged in the computer network operations;
    \item the aspects of active cyber defence are explored, but responsive activities are not considered. Despite the responsive cyber defence being a subset for active cyber defence, it possesses distinctive differences, especially that of responsive defence being directed primarily at external networks and systems instead of mainly focusing on activities within own systems;
    \item various sources interpret computer network operations differently and present various definitions, ranging from any attacks executed over computer networks up to being only applicable to the cyber warfare. A coherent definition is required to have a solid understanding of such operation applicability and implied characteristics;
    \item no special guide, manuals or proposals exist on computer network operation execution by the cyber red team. It might be expected, that such guidelines would be developed for nation's internal use only and not shared publicly, however, there is a lack of publicly available information on this topic; and
    \item the tackled issues for the cyber defence exercises are either narrow in scope, specific to a particular nation or small set of nations, restricted only to exercising just the decision making process or a small subset of a full-scale cyber operation, or limited to just simulation of common cyber attacks. Additionally, majority of the exercises are delivered for the \textit{Blue Team} defensive capability building, and the \textit{Red Team} is either simulated or role-playing the adversary. However, a dedicated technical exercise for training cyber red team capabilities is required.
\end{enumerate}

This thesis addresses the identified gaps to introduce
a unified understanding and definitions for the core principles, such as, \gls{rcd}, \gls{cno}, \gls{crt} and ``cyber attack kill-chain'',
explores the cyber red team offensive and defensive capabilities from the perspective of the cyber red team responsive computer network operations, 
presents practical and immediately applicable cyber red team \gls{tttp} to complement the conducted responsive operations,
proposes automated anomaly detection and cyber deception usage within the cyber red team's operational network for its protection, situational awareness, threat assessment and adversary tracking, and
defines the requirements for the technical exercises aimed directly at cyber red team capability development and preparation for real-life full-spectrum cyber operation execution.
