\section*{ABSTRACT \\ \ThesisTitleENG}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ABSTRACT}
%Abstract is similar to the abstract of a research paper but more thorough (advisable length is 1--2 pages).
%It briefly revisits the content of the thesis, including the motivation for this work, novelty with respect to the previous work, problem definition, methodology, results and conclusions.
This thesis, based on the collection of published and cited publications, explores the aspects of cyber red team responsive computer network operations, addresses the aspects of an asymmetric response to a stronger adversary, assesses threat detection and cyber deception method applicability, and examines the training requirements for the cyber red team.

In the age of state-affiliated and non-affiliated actors pursuing their agendas within and through the cyberspace, anyone can fall as a potential victim or unwitting accomplice to conducted cyber operations, such as, cyber espionage, cyber sabotage, spread of malware, creation of botnets, conduct of cyber attacks, on-line fraud, identity stealing, information warfare, and information system infiltration. Sophisticated and resourceful threat actors, deciding to maintain persistence in their victim's computer networks, can potentially inflict significant damage, such as, sensitive information exfiltration, data modification, sabotage the integrity of the targeted processes, and presumably inflict kinetic impact. For a targeted victim nation or nation-affiliated entity to respond to such a threat, the proper threat detection and situational awareness techniques need to be deployed in the first place. To support the response against an ongoing or expected cyber attack, the proper capabilities and methods need to be established and created. Cyber red team, equipped with specialized techniques, tools, tactics and procedures, and tasked with engaging the adversary as part of the responsive cyber defence, can provide an unconventional and asymmetric response to the threat. This thesis proposes novel techniques, which are applicable to cyber red team to develop new tools, apply tactics and procedures to conduct the responsive computer network operations. Proposed techniques, prototyped in tools, are tested and compared against other common and popular solutions in that area. The results in the listed publications and as presented in this thesis, show the strengths and advantages of the proposed techniques.

For the response to be possible, some level of initial attribution is required to identify the source of attack, the attack paths taken, and start tracing back to it's origin. To enable this, proper solutions and adequate approaches are needed in order to have situational awareness and possibilities for adversary identification. Within the first stages of the response, before engaging the specialized cyber red team, a combination of passive and active defence solutions have to be employed, such as, network intrusion detection and prevention system, log analysis and anomaly detection, honeypots, honey-nets, cyber decoys, and honey-tokens. Specialized cyber red team, engaged in responsive computer network operations, requires equal capabilities and visibility to continue tracking the adversary, while pursuing it through the cyberspace, beyond the protected systems. Such techniques and solutions become part of the cyber red team's OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act) loop to aid in detecting and observing the adversary. This becomes more important, if the adversary decides to engage in counter-cyber red team operation, thus potentially endangering the execution of an ongoing responsive computer network operation. System log-based anomaly detection and cyber deception have established themselves as prominent technologies, advancing beyond regular detection and defence. This thesis assesses and confirms the applicability of such technique integration into the cyber red team work-flow to assist with at least situational awareness, threat detection, adversary assessment, technical attribution, and cyber red team's operational infrastructure and asset protection.

The cyber red team selection, training, and skill-set advancement is a necessary part of such capability establishment and development. This becomes essential, when considering the training designed to prepare the team for real-life engagements and cyber operations. Technical exercises, developed to meet the real-life operations as close as possible, provide one of the options for such training and skill development. This thesis explores a cyber red team oriented technical exercise as a use case to establish the exercise design goals, training and mission objectives, the level of technical challenge sophistication, red team management and chain-of-command challenges, applicability of novel techniques, tools, tactics and procedures, cyber-kinetic interaction, legal implications, and situational awareness feedback. The author's created and managed technical exercise combines all of the explored aspects within this thesis, conducted research, and listed publications. One of the main corner-stones of the described exercise is the near real-time situational awareness and attack detection feedback to the training audience. This feedback is intended to provide immediate visibility on how the conducted attacks appear, are being detected by various solutions, and allow the cyber red team to improve their approaches by mitigating the identified drawbacks and mistakes. With this unique visibility, the red team members are able to verify their tools, apply new ones, experiment with various tactics and procedures, to observe the detection of their actions, and identify in what ways the level of stealth can be improved. Thesis verifies the benefits of the presented exercise, its technical concepts, employed techniques, tools, tactics and procedures, mutual interdependencies with kinetic game-play, and the near real-time feedback to the cyber red team.

The author acknowledges the variety of different penetration testing and attack tools already available publicly on source code sharing services, such as, GitHub and SourceForge. Despite some of those projects being applicable to cyber red teaming, even less of them can be used for the responsive computer operations. This thesis acknowledges and assesses some of the most prominent tools, which can be used to further benefit the cyber red team campaign. However, the emphasis of this thesis is put towards the novel techniques and ideas, which can be applied by the cyber red team to develop specialized tools tailored for computer network operations. It has to be noted, that presented techniques and approaches are applicable not only to cyber red team executed responsive computer operations, but can be applicable to other red teaming activities, penetration testing, and more cyber operations, such as, computer network attack and exploitation.
Additionally, the author recognizes the significant work already done by various cyber security companies, threat detection and assessment enterprises, and governmental organizations and initiatives, for identifying and assessing global threat actors and their techniques, tools, tactics and procedures. The knowledge and information made public by these entities and initiatives is used within this thesis to be built on top of it and use it as a catalyst for further advancements.
Furthermore, the author is fully aware of the ethical considerations this work may tackle, such as, the proposed technique usage to do harm, inflict damage, and conduct malicious cyber attacks. It has to be accepted, that any development, especially in cyber security, may have dual-use implications to benefit both the attacker and the defender. This, for sure, is part of the endless quest between defence and attack, however, the author hopes that the presented work will allow the defenders to increase the protection of the information systems by introducing the concept of counter-attack as part of the responsive cyber defence.

\section*{KOKKUV\~{O}TE\\ \ThesisTitleEST }
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{KOKKUV\~{O}TE} 
Käesolev doktoritöö põhineb autori publikatsioonidel ja uurib punase meeskonna küberoperatsioone vastusena vastase operatsioonidele, tugevamale vastasele asümmeetrilise vastupanu osutamist, ohu avastamise ja petteoperatsioonide kasutusvõimaluste hindamist küberruumis ning nõudeid punase meeskonna väljaõppele.

Kuna erinevad riiklikud ja mitte-riiklikud aktorid kasutavad oma eesmärkide saavutamiseks küberruumi, võib igaüks langeda mingi küberoperatsiooni ohvriks või tahtmatuks kaasosaliseks, sh puutuda kokku küberspionaaži, kübersabotaaži, pahavara, botivõrkude, küberrünnete, netipettuste, identiteedivarguse, infosõja ja infosüsteemidesse tungimisega. Kõrgeltarenenud ja leidlikud aktorid võivad põhjustada oma ohvrite võrkudes olulist kahju, sh tundliku info vargused, andmete muutmine, protsesside terviklikkuse saboteerimine, millega võib kaasneda füüsiline kahju. Selleks, et sihikule võetud riigil või organisatsioonil oleks võimalus sellistele ohtudele vastu seista, on esmajärjekorras vaja sobivat ohtude avastamise ja situatsiooniteadlikkuse süsteemi. Samuti on vaja käimasolevale või oodatavale küberründele vastamiseks sobivaid võimekusi ja meetodeid. Küberruumis opereeriv punane meeskond, mis on varustatud vastavate tehnikate, tööriistade, taktikate ja protseduuridega ning millele on antud ülesandeks küberohule reageerimine, võib anda vastasele ebakonventsionaalse ja asümmeetrilise vastuse. Käesolev doktoritöö kirjeldab uudseid tehnikaid punase meeskonna küberoperatsioonideks vajalike tööriistade, taktikate ja protseduuride arendamiseks. Välja pakutud tehnikad on rakendatud prototüüptööriistades ning testitud ja võrreldud olemasolevate populaarsete lahendustega. Doktoritöö aluseks olevates artiklites detailselt kirjeldatud tulemused näitavad välja pakutud tehnikate tugevusi ja eeliseid olemasolevate ees.

Selleks, et vastase ründele küberoperatsioonidega vastata, tuleb esmalt rünnet analüüsida, et identifitseerida ründe allikas ja ründega seotud süsteemid. Situatsiooniteadlikkuse omamiseks ja vastase identifitseerimise võimaldamiseks on tarvis sobivaid lahendusi ja lähenemisviise. Enne punase meeskonna kaasamist vastuoperatsioonidesse tuleb rakendada erinevaid passiivseid ja aktiivseid kaitsemeetmeid, nt. sissetungituvastus- ja –tõrjesüsteemid (IDS ja IPS), logianalüüs ja anomaaliatuvastus, meepotid ja –võrgud, peibutised, jne. Vastuoperatsioonidele spetsialiseerunud punane meeskond vajab juurdepääsu ja võimekust vastase jälitamiseks nii oma kui võõrastes süsteemides. Sellised tehnikad ja lahendused on osaks punase meeskonna OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act – märka, orienteeru, otsusta, tegutse) tsüklist, mis aitab vastast avastada ja jälgida. See muutub olulisemaks, kui vastane otsustab omakorda mõjutada punase meeskonna küberoperatsioone ja seab seeläbi ohtu meeskonnale seatud eesmärgi täitmise. Süsteemilogidel põhinev anomaaliatuvastus ja küberpeibutiste kasutamine on osutunud olulisteks tehnoloogiateks, mis laiendavad traditsioonilisi kaitsemeetmeid. Käesolev doktoritöö hindab antud tehnikate integreerimise võimalusi punase meeskonna töövoogudesse, et parandada situatsiooniteadlikkust, ohtude avastamist, vastase (võimekuse) määratlemist, ründe allika kindlakstegemist ning punase meeskonna operatiivtaristu ja varade kaitsmist.

Punase meeskonna liikmete valik, väljaõpe ja oskuste arendamine on selle võime arendamisel tähtis osa, eriti arvestades nende ettevalmistamist päris operatsioonide läbiviimiseks. Realistlikult disainitud tehnilised õppused on üks viis sellise väljaõppe pakkumiseks. See doktoritöö sisaldab juhtumiuuringut ühe punase meeskonna jaoks loodud tehnilise õppuse kohta, sh õppuse eesmärkide, disaini, õppetulemite, tehnilise keerukuse, punase meeskonna juhtimise, uudsete tehnikate kasutuselevõtu, sobivate tööriistade, taktikate ja protseduuride valiku, küber-kineetilise koostoime, juriidiliste aspektide ja situatsiooniteadlikkuse tagasisidega seonduvate teemade kohta. Neid autori loodud ja juhitud õppuse aspekte ongi käesolevas töös ning selle aluseks olevates publikatsioonides süvitsi uuritud.

Üks antud õppuse nurgakivisid on reaalajalähedane situatsiooniteadlikkuse ja ründetuvastuse tagasiside õppuse sihtgrupile. Tagasiside kaudu saavad õppusel osalejad teada, kuidas nende poolt läbi viidud operatsioon näeb välja vastase ja kõrvaliste osapoolte jaoks, mis omakorda annab neile võimaluse lihvida oma tehnikaid ja protseduure, eksperimenteerida tööriistadega ning vajadusel viia sisse muudatusi oma töövoos. Doktoritöö kinnitab antud õppuse kasulikkust, selle aluseks olevaid tehnilisi kontseptsioone, tehnikaid, tööriistu ja protseduure, kineetilise osa koostoimega kaasnevaid mõjusid küberoperatsioonidele, ning reaalajalähedase tagasiside olulisust punase meeskonna väljaõppes.

Selle töö autor on teadlik paljudest erinevatest läbistustestimise vahenditest ja ründetööriistadest, mis on avalikkusele kättesaadavad koodijagamisteenuste nagu GitHub ja SourceForge kaudu. Teisalt on vaid mõned neist kasutatavad punase meeskonna operatsioonides, ning neist omakorda vaid osa on kasutatavad vastuoperatsioonide kontekstis. Doktoritöö raames vaadeldakse ja hinnatakse olulisemate tööriistade kasutusvõimalusi antud operatsioonidel, kuid töö keskmes on uudsed tehnikad ja ideed, mida saab rakendada punase meeskonna jaoks spetsiaalsete tööriistade loomisel. Antud tehnikad on rakendatavad mitte ainult vastuoperatsioonide, vaid ka nt. läbistustestide, võrgurünnete ja võrguluure kontekstis. Lisaks, autor tunnustab küberturbeettevõtete ja valitsusasutuste tehtud tööd globaalsete ohtude identifitseerimisel ja nende tehnikate, tööriistade, taktikate ja protseduuride hindamisel. Nende avaldatud informatsioon on olnud oluline katalüsaator antud töö raames välja pakutud uudsete lahenduste arendamisel. Lisaks, autor on täiesti teadlik antud tööga kaasnevatest eetilistest küsimustest, kuna valedes kätes võivad loodud lahendused ja teadmised olla ohuks. Kahjuks ei saa küberturbe alases uurimistöös mööda faktist, et paljud leiud on ühtemoodi kasulikud nii kaitsja kui ründaja seisukohast. Autori lootus on, et antud töö annab selles igaveses võidurelvastuses kaitsepoolele eelise, võimaldades juurutada vastuoperatsioonide kontseptsiooni küberkaitses.
